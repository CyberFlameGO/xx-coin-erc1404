## This project contains the ERC1404 smart contract code for the initial distribution of xx coins

### xx coin

The **xx coin** is a digital currency that has been designed to be part of the decentralized ecosystem of the xx network.

The **xx network** will support decentralized messaging, payments, and dApps and was designed in response to growing public concern for **user privacy** as well as the emerging threat of **quantum computing**.

The **Elixxir communications layer** provides groundbreaking **privacy and security** by shredding user metadata while **Praxxis** provides a **denominated coin structure** that breaks payments into individual coins to provide privacy. The xx coins and the Praxxis breakthrough **blockchain consensus protocol** that enables them are based on distinctive hash-based cryptography, which is secure against attacks from current nation-state adversaries and future quantum computers.

In the genesis block, one billion xx coins will be minted. By MainNet, it is planned that the smart contracts will convert to official xx coins on the xx network, possibly via an intermediary smart contract.
